# 100% Good SugarCube-Guide
Welcome to the Git Repository for the **100% Good Twine SugarCube Guide**.

## *What is this?*
The **100% Good Twine SugarCube Guide** is a coding guide for the SugarCube format of Twine. It is meant as an alternative to the SugarCube documentation, with further explanations, interactive examples, and organised by difficulty. The goal of this guide is to make the learning curve for new SugarCube user less steep.

As of this release, it is up to date with the version 2.37.3.
> While you can find a copy of the 2.36.1 version in the [relevant folder](SG%202.36.1%20Version), that guide is incomplete (missing Audio API) and does not cover the many changes from the newer version.

## *What to expect from the Guide?*
The guide covers the full [SugarCube documentation](http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/), as well as addition in examples, usage of macros and APIs, and accessibility of customisation.

The guide is separated into four categories, representing different difficulties of coding:
* The Basics
    * or the absolute basics to start with SugarCube
    * *No need for extra knowledge. Just the base needed to make something.*
* The Basics+
    * adding interactivity, and creating a fully rounded IF game
    * *May require a bit of CSS knowledge (formatting rules)*
* Intermediate Mode
    * adding more customisation and complex code
    * *Will probably require some CSS knowledge, and maybe some JavaScript*
* Advanced Use
    * the most complex macros and APIs
    * *Will surely require some JavaScript/jQuery knowledge*
> Note: The Advanced Use includes all the APIs, macros, and methods not covered by the previous categories. This *will* include code requiring very advance knowledge of JavaScript/jQuery to be used properly.

## *How to read the Guide?*
You can find a "playable" version of the guide on [itch.io](https://manonamora.itch.io/twine-sugarcube-guide), as well as a downloadable version (includes an HTML, and the source files). Or you can peruse the source file on this Github.

The "playable" version includes two modes of reading: a 'One-Page' view where the whole guide is scrollable from start to finish, and a 'Book' view, with a category/chapter/page separation. The first makes it easier to find information (`CTRL+F`), the latter makes the information more digestible (by bits).

The guide includes multiple indexes: Chapter/Pages, Macros, Functions and Methods, and API.
