<h1>100% Good Twine SugarCube Guide</h1>\
This guide was created as an ''alternative'' to the SugarCube documentation, including simpler explanations to the macros and with clearer examples when possible. It is meant to make the SugarCube format more accessible to new and learning users.
> ''Note:'' the //One-Page// button on the SideBar will display the whole guide in one page for easier search.

The guide covers the different aspects of the SugarCube format, from its particular markup, to its macros, functions, and APIs. It also touches upon possible customisation of SugarCube projects, with editing the StyleSheet with CSS or the JavaScript passage. And, it brushes upon aspects of accessibility in terms of code, design, and formatting.
> This guide is based on the [[official SugarCube documentation|https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/]], and is up to date as of the ''version 2.37.3''. For later version, please refer to the official documentation. /* It is unlikely this guide will get further updates, as SugarCube 2 is moving to maintaining-only state. Always refer to the documentation anyway when unsure about something*/
\
The guide is separated in different categories: ''The Basics(+)'', ''Intermediate Use'', and ''Advanced Mode''. 
Only the Basics are necessary to be able to create a game with SugarCube. 
Knowledge of CSS, JavaScript/jQuery may be required for more complex elements.
> ''Note:'' any coding done in SugarCube is case and character sensitive, meaning that 
> {{{name ≠ Name}}} or {{{" " ≠ “ ”}}}.

//Integer// : type of value, number
//Object//  : type of variable, can have multiple variables nested inside
	//Property//  : a sub element of an object
//Array//   : type of variable, can have multiple values inside

__Types of Variables__
//Temporary variable// ({{{_temp}}}) : an editable variable that disappears when moving to a new passage.
//Permanent variable// ({{{$var}}})  : an editable variable that tracks a value until changed or unset. 
//Setup variable// ({{{setup.var}}}) : a variable set at the start of the game, and cannot be edited.
//Settings variable// ({{{settings.var}}}) : a variable set with a Setting in the JavaScript passage.

__Other Concepts__
//UI//		 : User Interface, the page shown to the player
//API//      : Application Programming Interface, code that will trigger hidden built-in fuctions
//Macro//    : a block of code designed to do a specific task
	//Container// : (ref to macro) a block a code wrapped between an opening and closing tag 
	//Argument//  : (ref to macro) items set in the macro to process code.
//Function// : JavaScript blocks of code designed to do a specific task
//Method//   : JavaScript blocks of code designed to do a specific task, linked to a reciever
