<h3>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h3>\
There are many online courses to learn the basics (or further) of the Twine-adjacent languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery.
* the [[W3 School|https://www.w3schools.com/]] has the most beginner explanations, and lets you test and edit their examples.
* [[MDN Web Docs|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/]] is more technical but provides a more extensive documentation.
* [[jQuery|https://jquery.com/]] has also a special documentation website.

<h3>This Guide also uses...</h3>\
The {{{<<message>>}}} and {{{Dialog API}}} macros from [[Chapel|https://github.com/ChapelR/custom-macros-for-sugarcube-2/]].
The Accessibility Fix for the {{{<<cycle>>}}} macro by [[HiEv|https://www.patreon.com/HiEv]].

<h3>A Special Thanks to...</h3>\
* Chris Klimas for creating Twine, and TME for making the SugarCube format and the Tweego compiler.
