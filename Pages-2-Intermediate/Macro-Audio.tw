<h1>Adding Sound with the Audio Macros</h1>
Adding any asset to a project can be daunting, especially when it can involve so many macros. But adding audio is actually quite simple and, at the minimum, only requires the use of 2 macros: {{{<<audio>>}}} and {{{<<cacheaudio>>}}}.

* [[Setting up the Audio Tracks|CacheAudio]]
* [[Create Track Groups and Playlists|Macro-Group-Playlist]]
* [[Playing Tracks in a Passage|Audio-Macro]]
* [[Other Audio Macros|Audio-Other]]

<h1>Setting up the Audio Tracks</h1>
To use audio tracks in your project, SugarCube requires you to cache the tracks at the start of the game by using the {{{<<cacheaudio>>}}} macro in the {{{StoryInit}}} [[Special Passage|SP-Init]].

The macro has 2 arguments:
* the ID for the track, as a reference
* the [[URL|URL-Types]] of the file, or files if a track has multiple formats.
{{{
        :: StoryInit
        <<cacheaudio "boom" "music/explosion.mp3">>
        <<cacheaudio "synth" "music/synth.mp3" "music/synth.wav" "music/synth.aac">>
}}}
>'' Note:'' if possible, take into account browser support when adding audio tracks to a project. [[Not every format is compatible|https://caniuse.com/?search=audio%20format]].
\
<h3>Pre-loading some tracks</h3>\
If some tracks will be played from the first few screens and should be pre-loaded, the {{{<<waitforaudio>>}}} macro will do just that, by increasing the loading screen until the track(s) is(are) ready to play. 

Place the macro in {{{StoryInit}}} below the necessary tracks, to load ahead. The tracks below the macro will only be cached.
{{{
       :: StoryInit
        <<cacheaudio "boom" "music/explosion.mp3">>
        <<waitforaudio>>
        <<cacheaudio "synth" "music/synth.mp3">>
        <<cacheaudio "wind" "music/wind.mp3">>
        <<cacheaudio "water" "music/water.mp3">>
}}}

:: Macro-Group-Playlist [page] {"position":"3000,1200","size":"100,100"}
<h1>Create Track Groups and Playlists</h1>
On top of adding audio tracks to your project, you can also create groups of tracks, for a better control over multiple tracks at once, and playlists. The first is set by the {{{<<createaudiogroup>>}}} macro, while the second is done through {{{<<createplaylist>>}}}. Both macros need to be set in {{{StoryInit}}} ''after'' the tracks are cached (with {{{<<cacheaudio>>}}}).
\
<h3>Create a Track Group</h3>\
The macro only has one argument for the container, and one arugment for the sub-macro:
* {{{<<createaudiogroup>>}}}
** the name of the group, starting with {{{:}}}
* {{{<<track>>}}}
** the ID of the track(s)
Assuming that the tracks {{{beep}}}, {{{boop}}}, and {{{swish}}} were defined above:
{{{
       <<createaudiogroup ":controls">>
                <<track "beep">>
                <<track "boop">>
                <<track "swish">>
        <</createaudiogroup>> 
}}}
>'' Note:'' You cannot name your group with the following: {{{:all}}}, {{{:looped}}}, {{{:muted}}}, {{{:not}}}, {{{:paused}}}, {{{:playing}}}, as they are used for [[audio control|Audio-Macro]].
\
<h3>Create a Playlist</h3>\
The macro only has one argument for the container, and three arugment for the sub-macro:
* {{{<<createplaylist>>}}}
** the ID of the playlist
* {{{<<track>>}}}
** the ID of the track
** {{{volume}}} (optional), to set the volume of the track, set from 0 (for 0%) to 1 (for 100%).
** {{{own}}} (optional), to create an independant copy of the track for the playlist
Assuming that the tracks {{{beep}}}, {{{boop}}}, and {{{swish}}} were defined above:
{{{
       <<createplaylist "controls">>
                <<track "beep" own>>
                <<track "boop" volume 0.5>>
                <<track "swish" volume 0.3 own>>
        <</createplaylist>> 
}}}

<h1>Playing Tracks in a Passage</h1>
After setting tracks in {{{StoryInit}}}, you can those tracks to a passage with the {{{<<audio>>}}} macro. You also use this macro to target track groups, as well as controling the playback (ex: pause, volume change...).

The macro can be coded as is in a passage, or can be nested inside other macros, like a {{{<<link>>}}} or with a delay in {{{<<timed>>}}}.

When started, a track will play until it ends or another action is set with the {{{<<audio>>}}} macro.

The macro has 2 main arguments:
* the ID of the track or the group
* the list of action to perform (can be combined)
{{{
        <<audio "ID" action>>
}}}
\
<h3>Action List</h3>\
There are 14 actions that can be included in the {{{<<audio>>}}} macro to control how a track or group of tracks is played:
<<nobr>>
<table id="audio">
        <tr>
                <th>Argument</th><th>Explanation</th><th>Example</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>{{{play}}}</td><td>Start/Restart to play the track(s)</td><td>{{{<<audio "track" play>>}}}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>{{{pause}}}</td><td>Pause the track(s)</td><td>{{{<<audio "track" pause>>}}}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>{{{stop}}}</td><td>Stop the track(s)</td><td>{{{<<audio "track" stop>>}}}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>{{{mute}}}</td><td>Reduce the volume to 0, without pausing the track</td><td>{{{<<audio "track" mute>>}}}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>{{{volume}}}</td><td>Change the volume of the track(s)</td><td>{{{<<audio "track" volume 0.5>>}}}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>{{{loop}}}</td><td>Set the track(s) to repeat when reahcing the end</td><td>{{{<<audio "track" loop>>}}}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>{{{unloop}}}</td><td>Remove the looping (default)</td><td>{{{<<audio "track" unloop>>}}}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>{{{fadein}}}</td><td>Start/Continue to play the track(s), fading in from their current volume to max over 5 seconds</td><td>{{{<<audio "track" fadein>>}}}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>{{{fadeout}}}</td><td>Start/Continues to play the track(s), fading out from their current volume to 0 over 5 seconds</td><td>{{{<<audio "track" fadeout>>}}}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>{{{fadeoverto}}}</td><td>Start/Continue to play the track(s), fading it over a set amount of seconds to a certain volume level </td><td>{{{<<audio "track" 5 0.5>>}}}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>{{{fadeto}}}</td><td>Start/Continue to play the track(s), fading to a certai volume level over 5 seconds</td><td>{{{<<audio "track" fadeto 0.9>>}}}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>{{{goto}}}</td><td>Send the player to a certain passage at the end of the track(s)</td><td>{{{<<audio "track" goto "Home">>}}}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>{{{time}}}</td><td>Move the play of the track to a certain amount of seconds from 0 (start) to the max of the file.</td><td>{{{<<audio "track" time 60>>}}}</td>
        </tr>
</table>
<</nobr>>
Assuming that the track {{{space}}}, inside the group {{{:space}}}, has been cached, here are some extra examples:
{{{
        <<audio ":space" play>>
→ Will start to play the group of tracks called :space, all at the same time.

        <<audio "space" volume 0.65 play>>
→ Will start playing the track {space} at 65% volume

        <<audio "space" time 92 play>>
→ Will start playing the track {space} from the 92th second

        <<audio "space" loop play>>
→ Will start playing the track {space} on repeat

        <<audio "space" volume 10 fadein>>
→ Will start playing the track {space}, fading in from 10% to max volume

        <<audio "space" volume 0.15 fadeto 0.78>>
→ Will start playing the track {space}, fading from 15% to 78% volume 

        <<audio "space" volume 0.04 fadeoverto 27 0.96>>
→ Will start playing the track {space}, fading from 4% to 96% volume over 27 seconds 

        <<audio "space" play goto "Home">>
→ Will start playing the track {space}, and send the player to the passage "Home" when the track ends.
}}}
<h3>Group IDs</h3>\
Aside from targeting groups, the {{{<<audio>>}}} macro can also target the state of tracks.
{{{
        <<audio ":paused" play>>
→ Will start playing all tracks previously paused

        <<audio ":playing" pause>>
→ Will pause all tracks currently playing

        <<audio ":playing" stop>>
→ Will stop all tracks currently playing

        <<audio ":all" stop>>
→ Will stop all tracks (playing and paused)

        <<audio ":playing:not(:space)" stop>>
→ Will stop all tracks currently playing, except the ones in the ":space" group

        <<audio ":all:not(:space)" volume 0.40>>
→ Will change the volume of all tracks not in the ":space" group to 40%
}}}
\
<h3>The {{{<<playlist>>}}} macro</h3>\
This macro will work similarly to the {{{<<audio>>}}} macro, aside from targeting playlists set in {{{StoryInit}}} instead of groups or single tracks.  

The macro has 2 main arguments:
* the ID of the playlist 
* the list of action to perform (can be combined)
{{{
        <<playlist "ID" action>>
}}}
On top of the actions mentioned above for {{{<<audio>>}}}, this macro has three extra: 
* {{{shuffle}}}, shuffling the order of the tracks
* {{{unshuffle}}}, reorganising the order of the tracks to its original form
* {{{skip}}}, skipping the next track in the playlist 
{{{
        <<playlist "playlist" shuffle>>
        <<playlist "playlist" unshuffle>>
        <<playlist "playlist" skip>>
}}}
>'' Note:'' The action {{{goto}}} will not work with {{{<<playlist>>}}}

:: Audio-Other [page] {"position":"3000,1300","size":"100,100"}
<h1>Other Audio Macros</h1>
There are three extra macros that can affect the played audio.
\
<h3>{{{<<masteraudio>>}}}</h3>\
This macro will control the master volume of the game (overall volume), as well as affect all registered tracks, regardless of their state.

This macro only has one argument, the action:
* {{{mute}}} and {{{unmute}}}, muting or unmuting the master volume of the game.
* {{{muteonhide}}} and {{{nomuteonhide}}}, which will either mute or unmute (default) the master volume when the player moves to another tab or minimize the browser.
* {{{stop}}}, which will stop all registered tracks.
* {{{volume}}}, which will change the master volume to a specified level
{{{
        <<masteraudio action>>
}}}
>'' Note:'' the master audio volume can be changed at will by the player with a [[Slider Setting|SettingsRange]].
\
<h3>{{{<<removeaudiogroup>>}}}</h3>\
This macro will delete a track group, which was previously set with {{{<<createaudiogroup>>}}}, by targeting the ID of the group. As with the latter macro, it will not accept the following IDs: {{{:all}}}, {{{:looped}}}, {{{:muted}}}, {{{:not}}}, {{{:paused}}}, {{{:playing}}}.
{{{
        <<removeaudiogroup ":space">>
}}}
\
<h3>{{{<<removeplaylist>>}}}</h3>\
This macro will delete a playlist, which was previously set with {{{<<createplaylist>>}}}, by targeting the ID of the playlist.
{{{
        <<removeplaylist "playlist">>
}}}
