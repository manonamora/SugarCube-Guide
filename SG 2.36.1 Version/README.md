# 100% Good SugarCube-Guide
This folder contains the previous substantial update (Version 1.2.1) for the **100% Good Twine SugarCube Guide**. That release covered most of SugarCube version 2.36.1, excluding some functions and the Audio API chapter.
> Note: This is an archive version. I won't be fixing any broken code (bug/mistake/typo).

This folder includes:
* the playable guide (.html)
* the .tw file of the guide
* the .zip folder of the source code of the guide

These files were formerly available on [itch.io](https://manonamora.itch.io/twine-sugarcube-guide)
> I do recommend you upgrade to SugarCube 2.37, as the new version fixes a lot of things. 
> However, if you are set with 2.36, note that the official [SugarCube documentation](http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/) only matches the current SugarCube version, which includes deprecating and removing macros, functions and APIs.
